# Project-5

This repository contains the Mars Colony App - a project assigned by Red Academy.

technologies used in this project:
Sass/css    Angular   Typescript/javascript    Postman   API   JSON    Github    HTTP requests    ngAnimations

Welcome to Mars!  Use this app to register yourself as the newest colonist to the Martian colony.  Check out the alien sightings in your area and on Mars as a whole.  Have you encountered an alien, yourself?  Then report your encounter so the matter can be dealt with in the most bureaucratic way possible!

This project was a great excercise in using APIs and implementing my knowledge of css obtained in this course in a creative way.

I learned a lot about typescript and the different things it can do in conjunction with Angular.

The creative freedom allowed in this project was very enjoyable.
